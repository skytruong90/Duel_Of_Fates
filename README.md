# Title: Duel Of Fates

**Duel Of Fates** is a strategic card game project initially developed during **HackUSU 2024**. This version is adapted to use C++ and focuses on streamlined gameplay and simplified mechanics.

## Development Environment

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Game Engine**: Simple and Lightweight Game Library (SFML) for C++
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Game Concept

Players select characters and decks from various historical eras (Ancient Rome, Early America, Future) to engage in battles against AI opponents. The game is won by strategically playing cards to deplete the opponent's health bar.

### Key Features:

- **Deck Selection**: Players choose from different thematic decks.
- **AI Opponent**: Compete against a computer-controlled opponent.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Simple turn-based card mechanics.
- **Winning Condition**: Reduce the opponent's health to zero.

## How to Use This Game

1. **Installation**: Download and compile the game's source code.
2. **Starting the Game**: Execute the compiled executable to start the game.
3. **Choosing a Deck**: At the start, select your deck through a simple menu interface.
4. **Playing Cards**: Use keyboard inputs to choose and play cards during your turn.
5. **Winning the Game**: Apply strategies to effectively use your cards and manage your resources.

## How to Improve the Game

- **Expand Deck Options**: Increase the number of decks and cards to enhance strategic depth.
- **Multiplayer Capability**: Add support for multiplayer to allow battles against other players.
- **Advanced AI**: Upgrade the AI for more challenging gameplay.
- **Graphical Enhancements**: Improve graphics and animations for a better visual experience.

## What I Learned

Transitioning the project from Lua and Love2D to C++ and SFML provided valuable insights into the differences in language syntax, game library capabilities, and performance optimizations.

## Game Operation and Build Details

**Duel Of Fates** operates on a simple turn-based mechanic. Players and the AI take turns playing cards with specific abilities to attack or defend. The game leverages the SFML library for handling graphics and user inputs, offering a robust platform for future expansions.

### Building the Game

1. **Game Logic**: Implement the basic gameplay rules and mechanics.
2. **User Interface**: Develop a clean and responsive UI for game interactions.
3. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct rigorous testing to ensure stability and optimize performance.
4. **Final Touches**: Refine user experience and graphical elements to complete the game.
